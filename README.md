# datahub-glossary-workflow
Datahub glossary ingestion workflow. It uses the Excel spreadsheet as a template where user can enter their glossary nodes and terms, then the Python and bash script works together to ingest the glossary into datahub. It can be added to the cicd pipeline with few additional assertions in the cicd to make sure the workflow did not fail.
